# PSMoveVR

PSMoveVR is a software set which allows usage of the PSMove controllers as normal SteamVR devices. It consists of the Core, which does most of the tracking work and the Driver, which communicates with the Core and passes data to SteamVR.

This package is still very new, but I've got the Python version of it running fantastic. Head to [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4RB2ipeyjkX6UHJL9HfIOQ) channel to see footage of both the old and new versions.

Current features:
- User-friendly UI/UX with a 3D visualization
- Easy calibration menus
- Fast multithreaded optical/AHRS algorithms for better quality
- (WIP) Dynamic recentering of the yaw drift
